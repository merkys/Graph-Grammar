=head1 NAME

Graph::Grammar - Graph grammar, i.e. rewriting method

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Graph::Grammar;
    use Graph::Undirected;

    my $graph = Graph::Undirected->new;

    # Create graph here

    my @rules = (
        [ sub { 1 }, ( sub { 1 } ) x 2, NO_MORE_VERTICES, sub { [ @_[1..3] ] } ],
    );

    parse_graph( $graph, @rules );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Graph::Grammar is a Perl implementation of a graph rewriting method (a.k.a. graph grammar).
Much of the API draws inspiration from L<Parse::Yapp>, but instead of acting on text streams Graph::Grammar is oriented at graphs, as implemented in Perl's L<Graph> module.
Graph::Grammar implements a single method C<parse_graph()> which accepts an instance of L<Graph> and an array of rules.
Every rule is evaluated for each vertex in a graph and, if a match is found, an action associated with the rule is executed.
A rule generally looks like this:

    [ $vertex_condition, @neighbour_conditions, $action ]

Where:

C<$vertex_condition> is a subroutine reference evaluating the center node.
The subroutine is called with the graph in C<$_[0]> and the vertex in <$_[1]>.
Subroutine should evaluate to true if condition is fulfilled.

C<@neighbour_conditions> is an array of subroutine references for the neighbours of the center node.
Inputs and outputs of each subroutine reference are the same as defined for C<$vertex_condition>.
Every condition has to match at least one of the neighbours (without overlaps).
Thus the rule will automatically fail if the number of neighbours is less than C<@neighbour_conditions>.
There can be more neighbours than C<@neighbour_conditions>, but if strict number of neighbours is needed, look below for C<NO_MORE_VERTICES>.
C<@neighbour_conditions> can be empty.

C<$action> can be either a subroutine reference, or anything else.
If C<$action> is a subroutine reference, then in the case of a match it is called with the graph in C<$_[0]> and remaining C<@_> members being graph vertices corresponding to rule conditions.
That is, C<$_[1]> is the center node, C<$_[2]> is a vertice matching the first neighbour condition and so on.
If C<$action> is not a subroutine reference, then it is cloned by L<Clone> and inserted instead of the center vertex.

There are two ways to request a particular number of neighbours for the central vertex.
First of them is to include an appropriate requirement into C<$vertex_condition>.
Second is to put C<NO_MORE_VERTICES> as the last element of C<@neighbour_conditions>, i.e.:

    [ sub { 1 }, ( sub { 1 } ) x 2, NO_MORE_VERTICES, sub { [ @_[1..3] ] } ]

=head2 C<NO_MORE_VERTICES>

When used before the rule action in a rule, restricts the number of center vertex neighbours to vertex conditions.
